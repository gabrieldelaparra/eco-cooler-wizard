# Eco-Cooler Wizard

A web UI interface to create a eco-cooler template for a window.

This project is a collaboration with [@notbloom](https://github.com/notbloom) as a fun weekend project. We wanted to work together in a coding project that could have some real world impact. 

We picked EcoCooler based on a [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/op_TO0wP4kI?si=7H-0t51-KGUgs28b).

After finishing the project and doing more research, we found a paper [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610219312093/pdfft?md5=fd3d59c5deeda47e7831608d145a5877&pid=1-s2.0-S1876610219312093-main.pdf) that mentions that the solution has no effect. \
We are no thermal experts, but the experiment seems non-conclusive (only 4 holes, same pressure&temperature inside and outside the box, no air volume difference, etc). We did not do much more research afterwards, but some sites mention that this should bring up to 5ÂºC room temperature cooling effect.

Anyhow, this project can help dimension a window/pane to make it a EcoCooler application. 

The user interface is made with BlazorWasm / C# and is hosted on Github Pages.

The UI allows to input some window measures (in inches) and will display a grid to ease the measurement and planning.
It should look something like this:

After adding the missing parts (wood/cardboard, holes, bottles), it should look something like this:

We just hope that this can be useful to someone (:
